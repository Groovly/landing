## What is Groovly?

Groovly is a music platform that lets anyone host live campaigns. A live campaign is a virtual stage where artists can showcase their music and fans can listen on and vote on their favorite artists.

## What can I get by hosting a live campaign?

Several things! Running a successful campaign allows you to:

- Get exclusive access to fan-sourced talent: Be first to discover those artists your audience truly likes.
- Get audience insights: Unlock useful intelligence and analytics data into your audience that can help you engage it and grow it.
- Promote the right talent: By using data you can create better, more targeted editorial content that’s uniquely relevant to your audience.

## What do I get by submitting my music to live campaigns?

As an artist, participating in live campaigns allows you to extend your music’s reach and get heard by millions of fans across the world to help you grow your fan base.

Having your music perform well on campaigns means you can access unique promotional opportunities offered by those hosting the campaigns, including exclusive interviews, getting your music playlisted and plenty more!

## Can I upload someone else’s music?

All uploaded music needs to be your own. We do not allow uploading music from third parties nor any music that you don't own the full rights to. Doing so is a violation of our Terms of Service and you risk getting banned from the platform.

## Will you profit from my music?

We do not monetize your music in any way, shape or form other than through the services we offer. Your music is yours and yours alone and you’re free to remove it whenever you like.

Our main purpose is to amplify and channel your work to help you reach further and grow as an artist.
